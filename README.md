An open-source toad-fetcher written in the LIMBO library for C++. Triggers specific system calls per 'toad fetch' given by the user which allows for extremely difficult HARP cracks. HTTP cookies received during a toad fetch will be modified to trick the server sent back in giving databases to the user. This method is illegal and OP. Once this method gains access to a server's database it can reverse engineer the database and gain remote access to the server, modifying it's OS kernel and leaking all the data stored on it. This occurs through a process known as BTS (backtrace sorting) that goes through data in a Trie to find everything that was behind it in sequence. In order to do this efficiently the BTS creates a hash log that increments by whitespace according to the filesystem structure. This hash log records changes made to a server in SHA256 hashes which can only be decrypted by the RSA private key. The public key is a 2048-bit key.

Try finding two prime number for that, bitch!

Special credit goes to Zenith AT who has supported me much in the journey of developing this which can literally fucking crack any fucking database! FUCK! Zenith AT, you are a legend, you dipshit piece of fucking dip shit cunt. Stupid retard faggot! I will NOT watch K-On, I dropped it long time ago ok?! X

In any event the functionality of Systoad is heavily dependent on background processes. For example if you are running a corroded subroutine within an address space that correlates to 0x00FF00 it will NOT work. This is because the mathematical interpolation between different subroutine address spaces can create perpendicular lines IF the address spaces do not add to 2. This is a problem that cannot be solved within the Turing model and DHCP tracking systems and will be an ongoing issue for the next century.
