An open-source toad-fetcher written in the LIMBO library for C++. Triggers specific system calls per 'toad fetch' given by the user which allows for extremely difficult HARP cracks. HTTP cookies received during a toad fetch will be modified to trick the server sent back in giving databases to the user. This method is illegal and OP. Once this method gains access to a server's database it can reverse engineer the database and gain remote access to the server, modifying it's OS kernel and leaking all the data stored on it. This occurs through a process known as BTS (backtrace sorting) that goes through data in a Trie to find everything that was behind it in sequence.
